Teeth Caries Detection and Risk Assessment
This repository contains code and datasets for a comprehensive study on detecting and assessing the risk of teeth caries using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project utilizes intraoral images, panoramic X-rays, and demographic data to develop and evaluate models for caries detection and risk prediction.

Key Features
Intraoral Image Analysis: Uses EfficientNet for high-accuracy detection of dental caries in intraoral images.
Panoramic X-Ray Classification: Implements object detection models like YOLOv3 to identify and localize cavities and other dental conditions in panoramic X-rays.
Demographic Data Integration: Applies Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM models to predict dental caries risk based on health and demographic information.
Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Includes scripts for data preprocessing using StandardScaler and handling class imbalances.
Model Evaluation: Provides comprehensive evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for all models.
Datasets
Teeth Images Dataset: Intraoral images categorized into caries and non-caries cases.
Panoramic X-Ray Dataset: X-ray images with detailed annotations for dental conditions.
Demographic Details Dataset: Health and demographic data related to dental caries presence.
Risk Prediction Dataset: Survey data on dental health habits and conditions.
